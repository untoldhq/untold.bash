#Useful Bash Aliases & Commands
This repository contains some useful bash aliases and styling. Feel free to fork and customize to your heart's content. If you add something that'd be useful company-wide, submit a PR so we can merge it in to the main repository.

##Installation
After you've cloned this repository, edit `~/.bash_profile`, adding the following line:

```source '/full/path/to/untold.bash/untold.bash.inc'```

##Commands
There are lots of useful things in this profile, you should read through the whole thing, but here are a few that are especially useful: 

* `s <file>` opens or creates the given file for editing in Sublime
* `be <command>` aliases to `bundle exec <command>`
* `gs` aliases to `git status`
